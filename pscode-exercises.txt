// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

// Ask user for a number
input number

// Check if the number is even or odd
if number modulo 2 equals 0 then
    print "The number is even"
else
    print "The number is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

// Initialize variables
total = 0
minimum = infinity // Start with a very large number
maximum = -infinity // Start with a very small number

// Read in 5 separate numbers
for i from 1 to 5 do
    input number
    total = total + number
    
    // Check for minimum number
    if number < minimum then
        minimum = number
    
    // Check for maximum number
    if number > maximum then
        maximum = number

// Calculate the average of the five numbers
average = total / 5

// Output the results
print "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
print "The smallest number is: " + minimum
print "The largest number is: " + maximum
